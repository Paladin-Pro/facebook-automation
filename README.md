**Facebook Post Interactor**
Facebook Post Interactor is a simple web app that allows you to like, comment, or react to Facebook posts using the Facebook Graph API. You can specify the post URL, the action to take (like, comment, or react), and the comment text (if you are commenting on a post).

**Getting Started**
To use this app, you will need to have a Facebook account and create a new Facebook app in the Facebook Developer Dashboard. Once you have created your app, you will need to obtain an App ID and App Secret, which you will use to authenticate the app and make requests to the Facebook Graph API.

To run the app, you will need to install Node.js and npm. Clone or download this repository, then navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:

**npm install**
**npm start**

This will start a local development server at http://localhost:3000, where you can access the app in your web browser.

**Usage**
To use the app, enter a Facebook post URL, select an action (like, comment, or react), and enter any necessary additional information (e.g. comment text). Click the "Submit" button to send the request to the Facebook Graph API.

Note that you will need to have an access token with the necessary permissions to perform the specified action on the specified post. You can obtain an access token by logging in with your Facebook account and granting the necessary permissions.
